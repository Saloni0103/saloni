        "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
        "\n",
        "Functions offer several benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "Code reusability: You can write a function once and use it multiple times in your program, avoiding code duplication and saving time.\n",
        "Modularization: Functions break down complex programs into smaller, manageable parts, improving readability and maintainability.\n",
        "Encapsulation: Functions can hide implementation details, making code easier to understand and modify without affecting other parts.\n",
        "Testing: Functions can be tested independently, simplifying the debugging process.\n",
        "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
        "\n",
        "The code in a function definition is not executed when you define the function, it's only executed when you call the function. Think of a function definition as a blueprint - it tells Python what the function does, but it doesn't actually run the code until you call it.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
        "\n",
        "The def keyword is used to create a function in Python. Here's the basic structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "def function_name(parameters):\n",
        "  # Function body (code to be executed)\n",
        "  return value (optional)\n",
        "Use code with caution.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
        "\n",
        "Function: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It's defined with the def keyword and has a name, parameters (optional), and a code body.\n",
        "Function call: The act of executing the code defined within a function. You call a function by using its name along with any necessary arguments (values passed to the function's parameters).\n",
        "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
        "\n",
        "Global scope: There is only one global scope in a Python program. It encompasses all code outside of any function definitions. Variables defined in the global scope are accessible throughout the entire program.\n",
        "Local scopes: Each function has its own local scope, separate from the global scope. Variables defined within a function are only accessible inside that function.\n",
        "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
        "\n",
        "When a function call returns, all local variables within the function's scope are destroyed. They are no longer accessible unless the function is called again.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Return value: The return statement allows a function to optionally send a value back to the place where it was called. This value can be used in the expression where the function is called.\n",
        "Return value in an expression: Yes, you can use an expression as a return value. The expression is evaluated, and its result becomes the return value of the function.\n",
        "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
        "\n",
        "If a function doesn't have an explicit return statement, it implicitly returns None. None is a special data type in Python signifying the absence of a meaningful value.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "To make a function variable refer to a global variable, you can use the global keyword within the function:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python\n",
        "global_variable = 10\n",
        "\n",
        "def my_function():\n",
        "  global global_variable\n",
        "  global_variable += 5  # Modifies the global variable\n",
        "\n",
        "my_function()\n",
        "print(global_variable)  # Output: 15\n",
        "Use code with caution.\n",
        "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
        "\n",
        "None is a special data type in Python that represents the absence of a value. It's often used as the default return value for functions that don't explicitly return anything.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
        "\n",
        "This statement attempts to import a module named areallyourpetsnamederic. However, it's highly unlikely that such a module exists. Python will raise an ImportError if it can't find the specified module.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
        "\n",
        "After importing the spam module, you would call the function using spam.bacon(). The dot notation (module_name.function_name) is used to access functions and variables within imported modules.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use try-except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully. Here's the basic structure"
